# Starting Development on a Feature
## What, Why & Who
The process a developer follows when beginning development on a feature. This process begins when the feature's ticket is moved from Up Next to In Progress.

## How
1. Move the ticket from Up Next to In Progress.
1. Read and understand **what** the ticket is asking for, and most importantly **why** the feature is being requested. A clear understanding of the **why** for a feature will inform the entire development process. If the **what** and **why** of the feature are not clear from the ticket, discuss it with PM vian audio or video chat.
1. Research and understand:
  * API calls
  * Database architecture
  * Process flows through the application
  Do so by:
  * Researching various options available for implementation
  * Writing a code spike to work out a preliminary idea of how the feature might be implemented. Code spikes can only be done **outside** the application code base.
  * Updating the ERDs
  * Updating the wireframes

1. From the research, come up with a plan
1. Update the Trello ticket with results of research and planning
  * Try to estimate time cost. Factor in time for designs, further wireframing, development, development research, testing, code reviews, QA, deployment
  * Use a 3 hour minimum as baseline for any feature

1. Talk with the customer and/or PM to determine what direction to take
  * Decide if ticket needs to be split into multiple, smaller tickets
  * Decide if an epic branch and deployment are needed for the feature
