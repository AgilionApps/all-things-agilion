# Code reviews

## Submitting for review
As the developer of a feature, ping the team members who have the most knowledge of the changes in the pull request.

## Reviewing
Before beginning a review, understand the **why** the change is being made.

Next, review the code for the following:
* Tests exist
* Tests passing and makes sense
* Understandability
* Code conventions
* Framework best practices
* DRY business logic
* Code consistency

When reviewing, ask the following questions:
* Is the intent of the code clear? Does it match the why?
* Is each commit self-contained? And does it have a clear commit message?
* Are the changes necessary?

Throughout the review, be thorough and **take the time you need**.
