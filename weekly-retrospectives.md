# Weekly Retrospectives
## What & Why
A brief meeting to identify problems and come up with solutions for them. The purpose is to make the development process more efficient.
## Who
The development team plus the client stakeholder. Everyone has an equal voice.
## How
Prior to the meeting, the PM should refamiliarize themselves with the problems from previous retrospective board. When the meeting begins, the PM should quickly run through the list of problems with the group and identify if any are ongoing. If they are, a breakout meeting with the relevant people should be scheduled.

The meeting can be done via video chat or in-person. Everyone needs to be on a computer so they can view and edit [the retrospective board](https://docs.google.com/a/agilionapps.com/drawings/d/1PXSGFc4ondtUmhvKiMCSxpzVnR2vkddZY4qEoW6YUQc/edit). Starting in the upper-left of the board, move clockwise through:

1. List what went well
1. List what didn't go well
1. Identify the problems from what didn't go well
1. Come up with solutions to the identified problems

Move through each step sequentially as a group. This means each person lists all the things they thought went well before anyone moves to what didn't go well. While identifying the problems, it's important to not jump into coming up with solutions before all the problems have been identified.
