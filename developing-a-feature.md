# Development on a Feature

## Process
* Unit test everything
* Isolate changes by branch, or at a minimum by commit
* Fully exercise the places in the UI where the changed code touches. Search the repo for instances of the things that have been changed.
* On every line of code, think about:
  1. Clarity. Is the change you've made clear?
  1. Maintainability. Will the code be easy to maintain?
  1. Performance. Will the code be performant?
