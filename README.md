##Governance

###Philosophy

Our team enjoys the work we do and the people we work with.

Self-directed and self-motivated people thrive at Agilion, others won't last long in the organization.

The company operates much like a Holacracy in accordance with shared vision and goals.  We seek the contribution of everyone at Agilion to continue shaping our culture and brand.

Agilion is owned and managed by partner owners who are responsible to clarify and steer company vision, strategy and process when necessary.

###Roles

Everyone at Agilion is a manager of one:  *Themselves.*

Everyone is in charge of their own career, setting an example, and being responsible to make things happen.

We trust everyone acts in accordance with the collective values and strives for success.

We want employee's to be remarkable and work to create vast amounts of value for both the company and themselves.

Being remarkable is measured in producing good results within the minimum billable hour requirement and helping to strengthen the reputation of Agilion as a premier product development agency.

Being remarkable happens through the gradual increase of experience across multiple domains while leveraging your highest skill and contribution through your core strength and competences.

Everyone at Agilion may play aspects of all roles at Agilion from time to time or act where they see a need.   Our key to collective success is working well with the strengths of other members on our team.

Roles in the company are broken down into two categories:  *Makers & Managers*.

####Maker roles

The role of the maker is to *build things.*

Maker schedules require zero to minimal meetings and interruptions in order to achieve a mental state of flow and creative productivity.

Success is measured by *quality billable deliverables.*

Maker roles include

* **Designer**:  Conceptualizes UI/UX interactions through wire framing and client-side programming
*  **Architect**: Designs solutions and integration plans through diagramming and written specifications
* **Developer**: Creates applications through full-stack programming (server-side, front-end, API, Databases)


####Manager roles

The role of the manager is to *build relationships.*

Manager schedules require more frequent task switching, communication and event scheduling in order to facilitate others outside the organization to contribute towards the success of the company.

Success is measured by *growing the company influence, reputation and resources.*

Manager roles include

*  **CEO**:  Steer company vision, goals & strategy.  Ensure right people; right roles.
*  **Marketing**: Position products within market demands, improve brand, turn customers into "evangelists"
* **Sales**: Help people get what they want, increase demand through sales process, discover and grow channels
*  **Operations**: Optimize internal systems and workflow automation
*  **Finance**: Improve positive cash flow and manage finances, de-risk liabilities
*  **Project management**: Track project status & budgets, proactive customer communication, coordinate resource schedules
*  **Product ownership**: Steer product vision and priorities



###Employee expectations

We expect three things

* Minimum effective billable hours
* Positive attitude
* Adopt Agilion values

####Minimum effective billable hours
* Avg. 32 effective billable hours a week
* Avg. 128 effective billable hours a month
* 1,536 effective billable hours a year.

When you work, we expect your highest quality billable work.
When you rest, we expect you to rest.
When you learn, we expect you to learn fast and apply it.

At Agilion, we value consistency and good creative energy. We value quality.  We value greatness and efficiency. If you're billing more than 40 hours a week, then we're going to be concerned that quality may be suffering. We want an average of 32 solid, quality billable hours a week. After that, we want you to learn, rest, and enjoy life.   While we don't track vacation or sick days, we expect that you'll take some time off periodically through the year. When you take time off, we don't want you working or checking in. We want you well rested to come back bringing your highest quality work.

####Display a positive attitude

Agilion has high standards and stretch goals.

Our success comes from the success mindset of our team and customers.

Morale and happiness of the team is crucial.  No one likes a downer and *constant pessimist.  Negative energy cripples the health of a team which needs be creative and produce results.    Bring your best to the work environment and encourage others to do the same.

**constant pessimism is not to be confused with realistic project analysis and assessments.*

All that being said.  No one can keep a positive outlook all the time. When you're having trouble with attitude, then we encourage the following

Three steps to work through negative emotions and regain positive outlook.

1. **Stop complaining**.   Complaining is not actionable and distracts yourself and others from tasks.  Instead, channel negative emotions, lost confidence and frustrations into clear problems by articulating things in specific observable and measurable terms.   A **problem** is the difference between what is *actually* happening and what you *desire* to be happening.  If after clearing describing the problem you feel a need to vent emotionally through complaining, then consider how that affects others in the company.  Will that help the team?  The answer is no.  Chronic complaining is a self-destructive behavior.  If you feel the need to vent, then consider hiring a therapist to help work with you.  Therapists or life coaching is recommended to anyone at Agilion who is seeking to grow and improve professionally.

2. **Reflect on what you accomplished**.  When feeling negative or stressed, it is helpful to reflect on things you have done well, and what you have accomplished so far in the given hour, day, week, month or even your life if you feel things haven't gone well lately.  Try to be grateful for things, and then re-focus your energy and build your confidence for the task at hand.

3.  **Change your perspective**.  After you've done the above, then take a moment to think about how you're thinking about the problem.  Can you explore any new angles?  Seek collaboration with the team and customers when appropriate.   Determine potential solutions for the problem, and then solve it.  Solving things is why you get paid.

####Adopt Agilion values

Act and resonate with a level of commitment matching Agilion values.  If it feels natural to you, then you’ll do very well.   If it doesn't, then it's best for everyone if you move on to another organization and seek collaboration with others that match your values.


###Partner expectations

* All the employee expectations (except billable hours depending on roles).
* Ensure fair compensation policies.
* Ensure strategic and day-to-day operations are aligned with success goals.

###Hiring & firing

Hiring and firing is a collective decision making process.

We always seek people with highest potential.  We seek high achievers and people who strive for success.

If someone isn’t able to excel at Agilion, then it’s likely a symptom of not being able to work as a team member or produce results through self-direction.

Ultimately, unanimous partner decision is needed to hire or fire an employee.

General grounds for dismissal are as follows:

* Failing to meet company expectations (i.e.: low billable hours, poor attitude, not fitting in with agilion values)
* Legal issues that are cause for dismissal

##Processes

###Why we have processes

As Richard Branson once said:  "*What works once may never work again. What everyone tells you never to do may just work, once. There are no rules.* "

Agilion's highest value is approaching every new situation with a unique ability to understand core problems, then innovate and produce solutions by leveraging the skill and experience of our product team.

Any other activity in our business is subject to elimination, outsourcing, or processes.  We do this so that our creative energy can be free towards adding the most value for ourselves and customers.

#### 1. Communication

Here is the process for what, when & why Agilion communicates.

| What | When | Where| Why |
| :-------- |:---------- |:-------- | :------- |
| Team breakfast | Mondays @ 8am | A restaurant in BTV  |  Team get-together & weekly plans |
| Team SCRUM | 15min; 9am, T-F | Google hangout | Individual highlights from yesterday, today's plan, coordinations as needed |

| Internal Chat | asynchronous | Flowdock room | Collaborate as needed |
| Face-to-face mtgs | only if needed | wherever it makes sense | better have a good reason, don't waste people's time |

#### 2. Collaboration & problem solving

Agilion's process for collaboration is based on the mastermind principle described by Napoleon Hill.

Agilion's process for collaboration is as follows:

1. A single problem is identified and articulated in observable and measurable terms.  (everything else is shelved for another collaboration session)
2. A desired outcome for a solution is agreed upon.
3. Everyone stays emotionally detached from any particular solution, how things should be, or any particular way of doing something.
4. With open minds, the team discusses possible solutions.
5. When a good enough solution appears, the team breaks down high-level action items and formulates an implementation plan.

#### 3. Customer engagement

Everyone at Agilion talks to customers.  There is no *project manager gatekeeper*.  It is a fundamental skill everyone at Agilion learns.

Here are some general guidelines for developers at Agilion when communicating with customers:

1. Always be professional, polite and think about the goals from our customer perspective.
2. If you're not clear on what the customer wants, then get clear by asking specific questions.  Use the six-sigma "why" method to understand root level motivations if needed.
3. Set clear expectations on when and why we communicate on a predictable schedule.   Agree on what type of information should be communicated immediately, vs. what can wait for checkins.  If a customer has a hard time prioritizing important actions vs. non-immediate distractions, then ask customer to verify the importance of requests to the LeanVision plan and main benefits.  Seek help from the team if needed.
4. If a customer gives you a compliment, then reply with gratitude.
5. If a customer treats you with disrespect, complains, or is being rude... then do not respond in haste unless you are emotionally clear-headed and can formulate respectful questions that help the customer describe emotions as problems.   Seek help from the team if needed.
5. Periodically ask customers at the close of scope of work assignments the question:  "*Would you recommend Agilion? Why?*".   Use that feedback.

#### 4. New Employee ramp-up

It is critical for a new employee ramp-up period to be as fast and as smooth as possible.

First 90 day benchmarks for new employees

*Day 1*

* Gain access and setup accounts to all things: * email, Github, web services, etc.*
* Set-up your localhost  environment
* Orientation on tech-stacks and Agilion documentation
* Open your first pull request to add your bio to company website

*Day 2*

* Shadow another employee on a contract for the day
* Goal setting session with CEO

*Day 3 - 7*

* Kick-off an internal Agilion project to practice the team workflow process (i.e.: Marketing website, internal tools, etc)

*Day 8 - 90*

* Work with team to integrate into billable contracts; (Agilion may or may not bill out your hours depending on the results)

*Day 90+*

* After 90 days, you'll be expected to direct yourself onto contracts and become remarkable to the organization.

#### 5. Team decision making

When possible the team enjoys making collective plans and decisions at weekly breakfast meetings that affect us all in the progression of our company.

However, as a company there will be thousands of micro decisions that must be made all the time. We expect you to make decisions and involve the right people when appropriate.   Some small decisions on projects require customer input, some don't.  Some decisions for the company require Partner level input, some don't.   A lot of times it doesn't make economic sense to drag in people from billable work for a group decision.

It also means you need to trust other people will make decisions without you because you're likely busy on billable work as well.

In general, if you believe the thing to do is right, and it is in line with the company values and expectations, then go ahead and do it.

If people are pissed about it later, then they'll tell you and we can all learn about why it was either a good or bad decision, and then life goes on.   Learn the lessons.  Forgive and forget.

#### 6. Portfolio management

Agilion works on multiple projects at any given time.

Every monday morning, Agilion reviews the status of each project in the portfolio and adjusts weekly resource plans as needed.

All projects are tracked on Agilion's *Active Project Portfolio* spreadsheet.

*Each project must have*

* designated project lead
* clear purpose and main goal for Agilion
* updated project status every monday
* updated budget forecast every monday

*General guidelines*

* Try to focus on one project in a week
* If you are working on multiple projects, then try focusing at least a full day on one contract to limit task switching
* Red-flag if you're task switching more than two projects in a given week.
* Project lead always communicates budget & capacity expectations immediately with customer if you know something changes estimates


#### 7. Project management, budgeting & estimation

Any new project for Agilion must have gone through a 1-page LeanVision exercise such that the web or mobile application has a clear purpose, main goal and major tasks that represent core benefits to a user(s).

Based on the main goal and major tasks, customers are asked to set a do not exceed limit of hours on our monthly capacity budget towards the development of each task.     We work within those budget constraints and scope work accordingly.  The focus should be implementing elegant solutions with the least amount of time possible that still retains high quality.  If not enough time is budgeted for a task, then it's best to skip that task all together.

At Agilion we do not set hard estimates or fixed date/fixed bid deliverables.

We believe web and mobile applications are always in constant improvement and iteration.  We do our best to communicate and iterate quickly which is always minimizing the customer cost at all times.

Agilion does our best to approximate and guess hours for each major task at the beginning of each week, however this number is only a ball park guess and should be treated as such.

There is a catch-22 phenomena in project management.  As soon as you estimate a specific thing to be completed by a future date at a future cost, then you're already setting everyone up for broken promises and disappointments because no one is able to control external circumstances which may or may not occur.

On the other hand, if people are too timid, fearful or hesitant about setting targeted timeframes and they push expectations to far out into the future in fear of disappointing people when missing deadlines,  then the actual work may not be executed in the most effective way and it will expand to absorb the estimated timelines.

This next concept, is something that we believe is a natural or universal law.

An individual is only able to *control* one thing:  **their own thoughts.**.

An individual at Agilion is able to *commit* to how they will operate.   They can commit to execute to the best of their ability within the time & budget constraints.   As a team, we will be creative, use constraints to our advantage and deliver in the best way we can while adapting to the changing external circumstances.

The art of project management and budgeting is thus to ensure plans are as clear as possible, are as simple as possible, communicated effectively as possible, and that people bring their best efforts to execute and deliver.

If a prospect or customer does not understand this, laughs at this philosophy, or insists we provide fixed deadlines on specific deliverables, then it's best to not start any work agreement on that project with that prospect.  If it is a customer, then we should suggest alternative vendors and part ways amicably.

Here is an example of how we schedule work and communicate budget constraints:

Scheduling is done within two constraints:

1. Agilion's available billable hour capacity that month.
2. The customer's budget.

For example, an existing customer approaches us with a requirement for their project.  They've already gone through our LeanVision process and so we know how to work effectively together.

Most likely Agilion will be at capacity for the current month.  So we'll inform the customer how many hours we have available.  An example project portfolio status may look like this:

| Project | Current Month | Month 2 | Month 3 |
| :---------| :---------------------| :-------------| :----------- |
| Project 1 |  200 hrs | 200 hrs | 80 hrs |
| Project 2 | 300 hrs | 200 hrs | - |
| Project 3 | 80 hrs  | - | - |
| TOTAL | 580 hrs | 400 hrs | 80 hrs |
| % Capacity | FULL | 69% | 14% |

While prospects and customers may give verbal estimates of how many hours they want in the future, we can only reserve time when a customer physically allocates appropriate budget funds into a 3rd party escrow account.  Funds are only paid to Agilion when we've invoiced actual hours completed.  This is a win-win situation because it ensures customers fully commit to the work and we don't pass up other opportunities with our other loyal customers.  It provides customers with peace of mind that they only pay when service is delivered.

In the example above, assuming we have 180 hours available the next month, and 500 hours available the 3rd month, then the customer may choose to reserve an appropriate amount of time within those time block constraints.

Then, the steps for project management estimates are very simple.  The customer agrees to a budget, we coordinate the escrow fund deposit, and then we incorporate the work into our weekly development flow.  We strive to get as much quality work done within that timeframe.  Everyone is happy.


#### 8. Product development

Leveraging conventions and constraints to develop products helps to ensure Agilion is able to better scope, estimate and complete projects with fewer unknowns.

General sequence of product development activity includes

1. 1-page LeanVision plan
2. Identifying a major feature
3. Wireframe and architecture planning
4. Front-end UX/UI implementation
5. Back-end implementation
6. Testing and deployment
7. Repeat 2-6 in quick iterations

#### 9. Billings, time tracking and expenses

*Customer Billings*

1. Upfront fee for LeanVision Workshop
2. Customer's deposit budget for next month in 3rd party escrow account.
3. Agilion sends invoices on 1st & 16th of each month based on billable hours.
4. Invoices are paid automatically from escrow account within 7 days of invoice.

*Time tracking*

1. Everyone records billable time (maker time) through LetsFreckle the same day work was completed.
2. Anyone may check LetsFreckle *pulse* to see who is billing on which projects
3. Write a brief and descriptive log for time records.  Example: *Customer check-in, review wireframes for user login UX, pseudo code approach, and implement the OAuth Gem.*

*Expenses*

1. We run lean on purpose, but employees have an accountable expense plan (see compensation plan for budget) to buy tools they need to be successful.
2. Partners must approve all company expenses.
3. In general Agilion pays for team meals, office, key vendors and subscriptions, marketing and sales operations.

#### 10. Sales

Agilion sales process

1. Request comes in.
2. Schedule 15-minute phone call and pre-qualify.
3. If qualified send quote, else refer to someone better suited to help.
4. Invest no more then two hours discussing or meeting with qualified prospect between a quote and close of sales cycle.  If prospect doesn't decide to accept/reject LeanVision quote after two hours of interactions, then they're likely not the best type of customer fit for Agilion.  We want customers who make decisions.
5. Upon acceptance of a LeanVision quote, schedule workshop and prepare agreements and new customer orientation.

#### 11. Tech Stack Fundamentals

At Agilion, we are fairly technology agnostic, but must ensure at the most basic level everyone on the team has a grasp of the current tech stack we most often employ.

Technology and tools change fast.   We keep up and use the right tool for the job.

**The basics** that everyone at Agilion must understand at both a theoretical and technical level:

* Generalist awareness of W3C web standards ( http://www.w3.org/TR/ )
* Principles for good interface designs
* Principles for continuous flow development
* Principles for product and project management
* Principles for team collaboration and problem solving
* Principles for product marketing and positioning
* Web and mobile application architecture patterns
* Relational database design patterns
* Non-relational database design patterns
* API design patterns
* Object-oriented programming fundamentals and best practices
* Functional programming fundamentals and best practices
* HTML5 programming language ( http://www.html5rocks.com/ )
* CSS3 programming language
* Javascript programming language
* Ruby programming language
* SQL database language
* Git ( http://git-scm.com/ )
* Less css-pre processor ( http://lesscss.org/ )
* Ruby on rails server-side framework  ( http://rubyonrails.org/ )
* Ember javascript framework ( http://emberjs.com/ )

#### 12. Reference documentation

Understanding where to quickly find key information helps reduce un-billable administrative time and allows the team to communicate, make decisions and coordinate activities much more effectively.

While individuals are free to create whatever documentation they want, it is important as a company to keep things as simple as possible.
The company has three directories in google Drive

* Customers Dir
* Management Dir
* Templates Dir

The naming convention for a Customer directory is *###-CustomerName*

#####LeanVision: 1-page business canvas

An overview on all the most important aspects of the business on a single page.  Provides high-level context for the Agilion team.   The first draft is completed during the LeanVision workshop and then updated when things change along the way.

#####LeanVision: product planning

This is a spreadsheet with four sheets: Roadmap, 1-page plan, user roles, user stories.  The roadmap communicates the sequence of big initiatives and how much budget is available for the big vision.   the p1-page product plan communicates the mail goal, status, budget and major tasks for the project Agilion is currently working on.   The user roles outline a narrative of what success looks like from an overall user experience for each user role.   User stories communicates desired outcomes from a user perspective relating to major tasks in the product plan and should reference success scenarios and concept wireframes.  Agilion continually updates this document with customers as ideas  and priorities are refined and changed.

#####Concept wireframes

 Communicates user experience of a product as it relates to the product plan.  The first draft set-up during a LeanVision workshop and then ALWAYS updated to stay ahead of design and development along the way.  Best practice is to mark revisions at various times and leverage the Moqups tool as a conversation aid.

#####Kanban discussion board

Like lean manufacturing, this communicates who is working on a given action for project at Agilion at any point in time.  It serves as a place to organize feedback and notes related to major benefits of the product.   The team uses this tool to organize what they need to do to make the product plan happen.  It is also a place for customers to leave comments and attach references as needed to specific work actions.

#####Portfolio and budget overview

This spreadsheet helps tracks overall project status, current project lead, and the budgets across all customer projects .   Adam updates this overview after each invoice period on the 1st & 16th of the month.
