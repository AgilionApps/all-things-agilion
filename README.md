###Philosophy

Our team enjoys the work we do and the people we work with.

Self-directed and self-motivated people thrive at Agilion.

The company operates in accordance with shared vision and goals.  We seek contribution of everyone at Agilion to continue shaping our culture and brand.

Agilion is owned and managed by partner owners who are responsible to clarify and steer company vision, strategy and process when necessary.

###Roles

Everyone at Agilion is a manager of one:  *Themselves.*

Everyone is in charge of their own career, setting an example, and being responsible to make things happen.

We trust everyone acts in accordance with the collective values and strives for success.

We want employee's to be remarkable and work to create vast amounts of value for both the company and themselves.

Being remarkable is measured in producing good results within the minimum billable hour requirement and helping to strengthen the reputation of Agilion as a premier product development agency.

Being remarkable happens through the gradual increase of experience across multiple domains while leveraging your highest skill and contribution through your core strength and competences.

Everyone at Agilion may play aspects of all roles at Agilion from time to time or act where they see a need.   Our key to collective success is working well with the strengths of other members on our team.

Roles in the company are broken down into two categories:  *Makers & Managers*.

####Maker roles

The role of the maker is to *build things.*

Maker schedules require zero to minimal meetings and interruptions in order to achieve a mental state of flow and creative productivity.

Maker roles include

* **Designer**:  Conceptualizes UI/UX interactions through wire framing and client-side programming
*  **Architect**: Designs solutions and integration plans through diagramming and written specifications
* **Developer**: Creates applications through full-stack programming (server-side, front-end, API, Databases)


####Manager roles

The role of the manager is to *build relationships.*

Manager schedules require more frequent task switching, communication and event scheduling in order to facilitate others outside the organization to contribute towards the success of the company.

Success is measured by *growing the company influence, reputation and resources.*

Manager roles include

*  **CEO**:  Create more value in the company andeliminate roadblocks.  Ensure right people; right roles.
*  **Marketing**: Position products within market demands, improve brand, turn customers into "evangelists"
* **Sales**: Help people get what they want, increase demand through sales process, discover and grow channels
*  **Operations**: Optimize internal systems and workflow automation
*  **Finance**: Improve positive cash flow and manage finances, de-risk liabilities
*  **Project management**: Track project status & budgets, proactive customer communication, coordinate resource schedules
*  **Product ownership**: Steer product vision and priorities



###Employee expectations

We expect three things

* Effective outcomes
* Positive attitude
* Adopt Agilion values

####Effective outcomes

At Agilion, we value consistency and good creative energy. We value quality.  We value quality code and business relations.


####Display a positive attitude

Agilion has high standards and stretch goals.

Our success comes from the success mindset of our team and customers.

Morale and happiness of the team is crucial.  No one likes a downer and *constant pessimist.  Negative energy cripples the health of a team which needs be creative and produce results.    Bring your best to the work environment and encourage others to do the same.

**constant pessimism is not to be confused with realistic project analysis and assessments.*

All that being said.  No one can keep a positive outlook all the time. When you're having trouble with attitude, then we encourage the following

Three steps to work through negative emotions and regain positive outlook.

1. **Stop complaining**.   Complaining is not actionable and distracts yourself and others from tasks.  Instead, channel negative emotions, lost confidence and frustrations into clear problems by articulating things in specific observable and measurable terms.   A **problem** is the difference between what is *actually* happening and what you *desire* to be happening.  If after clearing describing the problem you feel a need to vent emotionally through complaining, then consider how that affects others in the company.  Will that help the team?  The answer is no.  Chronic complaining is a self-destructive behavior.  If you feel the need to vent, then consider hiring a therapist to help work with you.  Therapists or life coaching is recommended to anyone at Agilion who is seeking to grow and improve professionally.

2. **Reflect on what you accomplished**.  When feeling negative or stressed, it is helpful to reflect on things you have done well, and what you have accomplished so far in the given hour, day, week, month or even your life if you feel things haven't gone well lately.  Try to be grateful for things, and then re-focus your energy and build your confidence for the task at hand.

3.  **Change your perspective**.  After you've done the above, then take a moment to think about how you're thinking about the problem.  Can you explore any new angles?  Seek collaboration with the team and customers when appropriate.   Determine potential solutions for the problem, and then solve it.  Solving things is why you get paid.

####Adopt Agilion values

Act and resonate with a level of commitment matching Agilion values.  If it feels natural to you, then you’ll do very well.   If it doesn't, then it's best for everyone if you move on to another organization and seek collaboration with others that match your values.


###Partner expectations

* All the employee expectations. 
* Ensure fair compensation policies.
* Ensure strategic and day-to-day operations are aligned with success goals.

###Hiring & firing

Hiring and firing is a collective decision making process.

We always seek people with highest potential.  We seek high achievers and people who strive for success.

If someone isn’t able to excel at Agilion, then it’s likely a symptom of not being able to work as a team member or produce results through self-direction.

Ultimately, unanimous partner decision is needed to hire or fire an employee.

General grounds for dismissal are as follows:

* Failing to meet company expectations (i.e.: low billable hours, poor attitude, not fitting in with agilion values)
* Legal issues that are cause for dismissal

##Workflow guidelines

###Why we have workflow guidelines

As Richard Branson once said:  "*What works once may never work again. What everyone tells you never to do may just work, once. There are no rules.* "

Agilion's highest value is approaching every new situation with a unique ability to understand core problems, then innovate and produce solutions by leveraging the skill and experience of our product team.

Any other activity in our business is subject to elimination, outsourcing, or processes.  We do this so that our creative energy can be free towards adding the most value for ourselves and customers.

#### 2. Collaboration & problem solving

Agilion's collaboration is based on the mastermind principle described by Napoleon Hill.

1. A single problem is identified and articulated in observable and measurable terms.  (everything else is shelved for another collaboration session)
2. A desired outcome for a solution is agreed upon.
3. Everyone stays emotionally detached from any particular solution, how things should be, or any particular way of doing something.
4. With open minds, the team discusses possible solutions.
5. When a good enough solution appears, the team breaks down high-level action items and formulates an implementation plan.

*Each project must have*

#### 7. Reference documentation

#####Concept wireframes

 Communicates user experience of a product as it relates to the product plan.  The first draft set-up during a LeanVision workshop and then ALWAYS updated to stay ahead of design and development along the way.  Best practice is to mark revisions at various times and leverage the Moqups tool as a conversation aid.

#####Kanban discussion board

It serves as a place to organize feedback and notes related to major benefits of the product.   The team uses this tool to organize what they need to do to make the product plan happen.
