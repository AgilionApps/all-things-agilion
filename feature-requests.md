# Feature Requests

Before adding a ticket, the client should discuss each feature internally with their company to make sure everyone there has the same goals for – and understanding of – the feature. This will reduce duplicate and potentially contradictory feature requests.

Once the feature has been vetted, the client can add a ticket directly to the Drop Lane – or coordinate with the PM – for the feature. Requests should not be made through real-time chat. If they are, it's the PM's responsibility to move the conversation elsewhere.

After a feature request has been added to the Drop Lane, the PM acts as the single point of contact until the feature has been assigned for development. The PM will – at the latest during a [daily check-in](daily-check-ins.md) – gain a preliminary understanding of the feature; part of this will be delving into *why* the feature is valuable to the business. Understanding the *why* is critical so we can propose the best solution.

The PM is responsible for each ticket having a clear title and description. The description should at minimum contain the following:

* As a <user role>,
* I want to <do X>,
* So that I can <achieve Y>.

An example:

* As a Judge,
* I want to see flag on each product card I'm judging,
* So that I can know at a glance what products I'm responsible for reviewing.

After the feature is clearly defined in the Drop Lane, it will be prioritized during a [daily check-in](daily-check-ins.md) by the client and PM.
