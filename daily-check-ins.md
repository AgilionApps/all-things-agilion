# Daily Check-ins

## What & Why
Daily check-ins are meant to facilitate a continuous flow of incoming tickets and prioritization between the client and development team. They eliminate the need for a weekly planning meeting with both those parties present. The goals are to:

1. Fulfill the needs of the business by addressing issues and requests early and often, and allowing for fluid reprioritization.
1. Reduce the client cost by having only the client and the PM present.
1. Allow the development team to remain focused by shielding them from meetings and the process of defining and prioritizing each bug and feature.

## Who
The PM and the client stakeholder(s).

## How
This is a daily meeting held either in person or via video chat.

1. Flesh out each ticket in the Drop Lane. See the [feature request](feature-requests.md) and [bug tracking](bug-tracking-and-resolution.md) docs for how to format each ticket.
1. Move the ticket to either the Backlog or prioritize it in Up Next against the existing Up Next tickets.

At the end of the meeting, the Drop Lane should be empty and Up Next should have no more than a few items per developer. As tickets are added to Up Next, tickets currently in Up Next will often need to be moved to the Backlog to provide room for the new ticket. We're working with one pie, so if we add a piece in another piece must be removed. We must be relentless in keeping Up Next short and realistic.
